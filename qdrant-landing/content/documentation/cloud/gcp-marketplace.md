# Qdrant Cloud on Google Cloud Marketplace

## Overview

Our [Google Cloud Marketplace](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/qdrant-public/qdrant) listing streamlines access to Qdrant for users who rely on Google Cloud for hosting and application development. Please note that, while Qdrant's clusters run on Google Cloud, you will still use the Qdrant Cloud infrastructure. 

## Billing

You don't need to use a credit card to sign up for Qdrant Cloud. Instead, all billing is processed through the Google Cloud Marketplace and the usage of Qdrant is added to your existing billing for Google Cloud services. It is common for Google Cloud to abstract usage based pricing in the Google Cloud marketplace, as there are too many factors to model when calculating billing from the Google Cloud side.

The payment is carried out via your Google Cloud Account. To get a clearer idea for the pricing structure, please use our [Billing Calculator](https://cloud.qdrant.io/calculator).

## How to subscribe

1. Go to [Qdrant's Google Cloud Marketplace listing](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/qdrant-public/qdrant).
2. Click the blue button - **Subscribe**. 
3. On the next screen, under Purchase, click **Subscribe**.
4. Up top, on the green banner, click **Set up your account**.

You will be transferred outside of Google Cloud to [Qdrant Cloud](https://qdrant.to/cloud) via your unique Google Cloud Offer ID. 

The Billing Details screen will open in Qdrant Cloud Console. Stay in this console if you want to create your first Qdrant Cluster hosted on Google Cloud.

> **Note:** You do not have to return to the Google Cloud Control Panel. All Qdrant infrastructure is provisioned from the Qdrant Cloud Console.
